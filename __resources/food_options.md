## Carryout Restaurants

* [Cafe Torino](http://www.caffetorinoseattle.com/) (Cold-brew so caffeinated, you'll swear it's more than caffeine. Plus sandwiches, soups, and pastries)
* [Pam's Kitchen](http://pams-kitchen.com/) (Caribbean)
* [Nollie's](http://www.nolliescafe.com/) (cheap breakfast sandwiches for lunch)
* [Metropolitan Cafe and Deli](http://metropolitandeliandcafe.com/locations/stack-house-metropolitan-deli-cafe/) (deli sandwiches)
* [Naanz](https://thenaanz.com/) (rice bowls, salads, and naan wraps)
* [Chipotle](http://www.chipotle.com/) (kinda far, but alright)
* [Lunchbox Laboratory](http://lunchboxlaboratory.com/) (sorta pricey, but delicious and greasy. plus boozy shakes)

## Food Trucks

There's usually a food truck in front of WeWork. However, sometimes there isn't, or you might not like what they offer.

Luckily, you can exploit the fact that Amazonians are around, and walk west on Republican St. towards Amazon. You'll run into food trucks and Amazonian herds in no time :).

## Lazy Method

Use [Peach](https://www.peachd.com/) and have your lunch delivered to the WeWork lounge. Options change daily.
