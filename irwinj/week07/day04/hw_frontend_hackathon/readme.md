#Frontend Hackathon

###Build something cool.

Your assignment is to build and style a frontend page/pages for our pre-built backend. The backend is built using Ruby and the **rest-client** gem that is making a request to the Yelp API and returning a collection of restaurants.

##Requirements

* Use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Jquery](http://jquery.com/) to style the main index page
* Utilize at least **1** JQuery plugin
* Focus on frontend
    * Make something visually interesting
    * Make something you'd be proud to show to others
* commit and push to github frequently 

Don't worry about backend for this project. However, if you finish and feel good about your frontend feel free to add features.

##Start the App
```
> bundle install
> rake db:create
> foreman run rails s
```

##Tips

- Always remember, _"good artists copy, great artists steal."_ Look at other websites and apps that you think are designed well and learn from them. Obviously don't make a direct copy, but derive inspiration from those who design well.

- Check out site websites like:
  - [adobe kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/) - to see popular color schemes and figure out what colors go well with each other
    - while you are there, learn about the basics of [color theory](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-color-theory-for-web-designers--webdesign-1437) - it is an __essential__ skill if you want to do front-end design/development  
  - [subtlepatters](http://subtlepatterns.com/), to find cool patterns for your backgrounds  
  - [iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) - for some good looking icons for your project
  - [behance](https://www.behance.net/search?field=102) - to see what people are designing and what the community thinks
